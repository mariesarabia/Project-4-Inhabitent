# INHABITENT

In this project, I created a multi-page website with a blog for a fictitious camping supply company in Vancouver called Inhabitent Camping Supply Co., using Wordpress as content management system. 

Contains: a custom static homepage, About Page, Contact Page, a blog post index page and a single view for blog posts, product archive, product type archive page, single templates for products, search results page and 404 page.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED:

WordPress, HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, Gulp, MAMP.


# LEARNINGS

In this project I learned how to install Wordpress locally and build a website using MAMP. I learned how to use a starter theme as a base for building the website, the use of the Wordpress Dashboard to control the behind-the-scene details of managing the website and effectively organizing the project's custom theme and plugin directories. 

I learned to create a custom page template that dynamically adds a hero image through a custom field, how to create a custom post type and custom taxonomy inside of a functionality plugin, how to properly enqueue CSS and JS files in the themes functions.php file and how to leverage the Wordpress template hierarchy to generate the required layout for the website.
